# Versioning and the road to a production-ready release version

The CAGL is still alpha software. The first public alpha release is version 0.1. Version 1.1 will be the first production-ready release version.

Between now and then, the names of functions might change and backward compatibility is *not* an object of development. From version 1.1 onwards, backward compatibility is vital.

Release versions have an odd first digit. Development versions have an even first digit.

The estimated release date of version 1.1 is unknown, but the aim is early 2015.
